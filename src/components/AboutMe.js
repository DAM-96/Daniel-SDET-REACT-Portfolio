              I'm a Software Development Engineer in Test with a passion for AI
              and all things automation. I've been a QA Engineer for the last 4
              years and I'm currently working on honing my web development
              skills to complement my existing abilities. As a hobby, I like to
              code simple applications, mostly on Python; and I play piano. In
              the following sections you'll be able to see some of my recent
              work, my contact info and my resume.
